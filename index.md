Welcome to Forecasting and Risk Analysis (BANA 4090)! This course is for junior/senior undergraduate students. The main objective of this course is to provide you with the proper foundation to analyze and forecast time series data in the professional setting. This means that in addition to forecasting into the future and evaluating such forecasts we will discuss other topics to prepare you for your journey as an analyst.  A survey of analytical techniques used in forecasting. Techniques include exponential smoothing, ARIMA, multiple regression and judgement-based methods.  Implementation issues and challenges are discussed.

<!---While covering core concepts like univariate and multivariate forecasting/evaluation of forecasts are critical, I believe we should also cover topics like approaching a forecasting a problem, wrangling with time series data/objects, advanced topics like neural networks for time series, hierarchical data and practical issues when approaching a problem and implementing a solution.--->


<!---This is a course in the analysis of time series data with emphasis on appropriate choice of models for estimation, testing, and forecasting. Topics or methodologies covered include Univariate Box-Jenkins for fitting and forecasting time series; ARIMA models, stationarity and nonstationarity; diagnosing time series models; transformations; forecasting: point and interval forecasts; seasonal time series models; modeling volatility with ARCH, GARCH; modeling time series with trends; and other methods. --->

## Learning Objectives

* Provide students with a foundational knowledge of time series analysis
* Expose students to a number of traditional and contemporary methods in time series and forecasting
* Familiarize students with many of the challenges associated with time series forecasting
* Provide students with practical experience analyzing real-world data and communicating the results


While I will try to focus on the application over the theory to maximize the above objectives, I will provide additional optional reading for those interested in a deeper dive into the theory ðŸš€. 

## Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to: 
* have a solid foundation for approaching time series analysis and forecasting projects in the future 
* provide of project for portfolio 
*	practice with R programming language as it relates to time series data

## Description of Major Assignments
 
 - **Exams**  â€“ There will be two exams given during class  after we finish module 2 and module 4 to assess grasp of key concepts of time series analysis and forecasting.
 
 - **Assignments**  â€“ 4 take-home assignments will be given throughout the semester. Students will have 2 weeks to complete the assignments. 
 
 - **Discussions**  â€“ The first 14 classes will have in-class labs/discussions. Write-ups from these discussions/labs are to be submitted on Canvas by 11:59pm on the   Sunday after class. If you cannot make the class, these will be posted and submission will be allowed.
 
 - **Project**  â€“ The project is a core component of this course. Students will pick a topic and dataset of their choosing to analyze and forecast with the methods taught in this course (and ideally some additional methods). These topics will be submitted during week 6 and the analyses will be presented during week 15. In lieu of a final exam, students will submit a reproducible markdown/notebook.
